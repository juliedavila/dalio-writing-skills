# Dalio-style diagnosis and operating principles

Two linked document types. In Dalio's 5-Step Process (Goals → Problems → Diagnosis → Design → Doing), a good diagnosis ends in a design change, and recurring design changes become written principles. This skill covers both, adapted for a blameless engineering culture: root causes describe the design by default, never a person's character, because the person-level version is where Bridgewater's practices turned harmful.

## House style (applies to both types)

1. **Levels.** Main points above the line; detail only under the point it illustrates. Separate "the case" (fix this instance) from "the machine" (change the system that produced it).
2. **Nutshell first** for the doc and each major section.
3. **Register split.** Facts and timeline as plain declaratives; judgments in first person with confidence.
4. **Numbers over adjectives.** Banned: "timeless," "universal," unquantified "significant/critical."
5. **Prose carries reasoning; bullets carry lists.**
6. Restate once per level. Bold one thesis sentence per section. Name teams/roles.

## A. Diagnosis / postmortem

### Nutshell (3-4 sentences)
What happened, impact in numbers, the root cause in one phrase, and the design change.

### Fields, in order
1. **Goal / expected outcome:** what the machine was supposed to produce.
2. **Actual outcome and impact:** with numbers (duration, scope, severity).
3. **Responsible party (RP):** the team or role that owns that part of the machine. Accountability for the outcome, not blame.
4. **How the machine should have worked:** a short description of the intended design (who/what was supposed to catch or prevent this).
5. **Proximate causes - phrased as verbs:** the actions or failures to act that directly produced the outcome ("did not rotate the key," "merged without required review"). Use a short timeline if needed.
6. **Root causes - phrased as adjectives about the design:** the reasons beneath the proximate causes ("unowned," "single-approver," "alert-fatigued," "undocumented"). Test: if this were fixed, would the proximate causes stop recurring? Person-fit or capability questions go to a private channel, never in this document.
7. **Which step failed:** goals unclear, problem not surfaced, misdiagnosed earlier, poor design, or poor execution.
8. **Pattern check:** has this root cause appeared before? Link prior issues. A pattern escalates the fix.
9. **Design change:** what changes in responsibilities, process, tooling or controls. Start with the high-level picture, then drill down to tasks.
10. **Tasks:** owner, action, due date.
11. **Case vs. machine:** one paragraph stating what was fixed for this case and what changed in the system.
12. **Principle candidate (optional):** if this reveals a reusable rule, draft it in the format in section B.

### Issue-log entry (one line, for trackers)
`Severity | RP | Outcome (one line) | Root cause (adjective) | Design change | Link`

### Do not
- Write root causes as character traits of named people.
- Count issues as a performance metric; measure recurrence and fix quality.

## B. Operating principles

### Structure
1. **Reading guide:** "The summary table is the whole picture; the rest explains each principle."
2. **Summary table:** every principle's number and one-line headline, before any elaboration.
3. **Principles**, numbered N → N.N → N.Na so they can be cited ("per 2.3b"). Group under at most ~7 top-level principles.
4. **Glossary** for any coined term.
5. **Revision log:** date, change, and the case that prompted it. Principles are written, tested against outcomes, and refined.

### Entry shape for each principle
- **Headline:** a short imperative in bold.
- **Trigger:** the situation in which it applies.
- **Action:** what to do, specifically enough to implement.
- **Rationale:** the cause-effect reason, in prose.
- **Worked example:** a real case (incident, decision) where it changed the outcome, with numbers if possible.
- **Less effective vs. more effective:** one-line contrast of the behavior.
- **Self-test question:** "How often do I/we ...?"
- **Sub-rules:** lettered (a, b, c), only if each is independently actionable.

### Specificity test (apply to every principle)
- Names a trigger and an action?
- Has at least one real case behind it?
- Could a reasonable person disagree with it? If not, it's a platitude; cut it or sharpen it.
- Is it fewer words than its rationale?

### Do not
- Turn principles into wall slogans.
- Exempt leaders from the principles.
- Include more principles than people can remember; cap the top level.

## Self-check before returning
- Diagnosis: proximate causes are verbs, root causes are design adjectives, every task has an owner and date, and the case-vs-machine paragraph exists.
- Principles: summary table first, citable numbering, every entry passes the specificity test, revision log present.
